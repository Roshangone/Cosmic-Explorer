### üöÄ Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites

  * **NASA API Key:** You'll need a free API key from NASA. Get one here: `https://api.nasa.gov/`.
  * **Code Editor:** A text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
  * **Web Browser:** Any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Add your API Key:**

      * Create a new file in the project's root directory named `config.js`.
      * Add the following code to `config.js`, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual key:
        ```javascript
        export const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
        ```
      * Create or update the `.gitignore` file and add `config.js` to it. This prevents your key from being uploaded to GitHub.
        ```gitignore
        # Ignore the file containing the API key
        config.js
        ```

3.  **Run Locally:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
